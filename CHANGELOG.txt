CHANGELOG

Version 0.1.5:
* Bugfix: h5 & h6 also create w:p's so any wrapping divs dont need to.

Version 0.1.2:
* Bugfix: span.h (MS Word Highlights) with sibling block elements could result in invalid wordml.

Version 0.1.1:
* Nodes with neighbor nodes that create w:p's need to be wrapped in w:p themselves.
* Fixed test suite.

Version 0.1.0:
* Rewrote xslt to support tables and updated rubyzip to v1.

Version 0.0.1:
* First basic implementation of htmltoword released.
